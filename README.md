# dzen2-bar2
A bit more advanced setup and complicated code base than the other simple basic version in "dzen2-bar" repository:
( https://github.com/Ermiq/Dzen2-bar ).

GitHub said "Add a ReadMe". So, I'm adding...

Just a basic dzen2 bar, written in Python. With exception of one Bash script that is used to start the bar.
I failed when I tried to figure out how to make it all in Python. Bar just dooesn't update when started from Python code.
I'm a total noob in both Python and Bash, so...

If you're looking for an example of a dzen2 panel/bar setup, not overwhelmed with different icon packs, without sparkles and whistles,
just basic stuff that will probably start successfully on another machine and not just on the where it has been developed,
then you're in right place.
